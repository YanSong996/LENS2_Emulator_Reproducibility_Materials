# Monthly
This sub-repository contains codes and key intermediate results related to the case study of monthly surface temperature. It serves the purpose of reproducing Figures S9-S13 in the Supplementary Materials. Moreover, it provides necessary examples to develop a monthly SG and generate monthly emulations.

## Code
1. "Monthly_SG.R" includes R codes for developing a monthly SG, given simulations and selected tuning parameters. It follows the Algorithm S1 in the Supplementary Materials.
2. "Monthly_GenEmu.R" include R codes for generating monthly emulations, given parameters in the monthly SG. It follows the Algorithm 1 in the main manuscript.
3. "Monthly.R" and "Aggregate/TestAggregate.R" includes R codes for reproducing Figures S9â€“S13 in Supplementary Materials. They can be taken as a supplement to the "Wrapper_Supplement.R".

## Outputs
All the intermediate results related to Figures S9-S12 in the Supplementary Materials can be found in sub-repository "Monthly/Outputs". All those related to Figure S13 in the Supplementary Materials can be found in sub-repository "Monthly/Aggregate".
