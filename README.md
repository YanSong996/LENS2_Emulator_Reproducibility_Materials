## Abstract
The Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensembles (CESM2-LENS2) represents a recently released comprehensive ensemble of climate change projections. It originates from the CESM2 and serves as a valuable resource for studying the sensitivity of internal climate fluctuations to greenhouse warming. CESM2-LENS2 uses CMIP6 historical forcing from year 1850 to 2014 and the Shared Socioeconomix Pathways 370 (SSP370) future radiative forcing (RF, an influential factor in climate system describing the difference between incoming and outgoing sun radiation) from year 2015 to 2100. Ten ensembles of surface temperature simulations spanning the period 2015-2100 from the CESM2-LENS2 are used in this work. 

## Availability and description
### Surface temperature simulations from CESM2-LENS2 (netCDF)
- CESM2-LENS2 data are available online at: https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens2.

- Surface temperature simulations at 3-hourly, 6-hourly, monthly, and daily scales, can be found in the atmosphere component of CESM2-LENS2. 

*** Monthly surface temperature simulations are avaliable at:

*** Daily surface temperature simulations are avaliable at:  
https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/dataset/ucar.cgd.cesm2le.atm.proc.daily_ave.TS.html

- This work utilized up to ten surface temperature simulations obtained from a subset of 20 members that were micro-initialized starting from the year 1251. Each member is created by introducing random perturbations to the atmospheric potential temperature field. 

Monthly surface temperature simulations used in this work are:
