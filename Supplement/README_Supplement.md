# Reproducibility Introduction for the Supplementary Materials
This file documents the artifacts associated with the Supplementary Materials and describes how to reproduce the findings. To reproduce all figures and results in the Supplementary Materials, please download and extract the provided "LENS2_Emulator_Reproducibility_Materials.zip", and then set your working directory to the folder "LENS2_Emulator_Reproducibility_Materials".

## Step 1. Download and process the data in sub-repository "LENS2_Data"
Please follow the README.md file in the sub-repository "LENS2_Data" to download the raw data, process and store them using file “Data_treatment.R” in the "LENS2_Data". Processing montly and annual data together for each ensemble takes about 63 seconds. Processing daily data for each ensemble takes about 32.5 seconds.

## Step 2. Reproduce each section and figure sequentially
### Figure S1 in Section S2
Please refer to the reproducibility of Figure 1 in Section 2.

### Figure S2 in Section S3.2.3
Please refer to the reproducibility of Figure 2 in Section 3.2.1.

### Figure S3 in Section S3.2.4
