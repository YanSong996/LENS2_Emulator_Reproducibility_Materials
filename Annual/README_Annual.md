# Annual
This sub-repository contains codes and key intermediate results related to the case study of annual surface temperature. It serves the purpose of reproducing Figures 3–5 in the main manuscript and Figures S5, S7, and S8 in the Supplementary Materials. Moreover, it provides necessary examples to develop an annual SG and generate annual emulations.

## Code
1. "Annual_SG.R" includes R codes for developing an annual SG, given simulations and selected tuning parameters. It follows the Algorithm S1 in the Supplementary Materials.
2. "Annual_GenEmu.R" include R codes for generating annual emulations, given parameters in the annual SG. It follows the Algorithm 1 in the main manuscript.
3. "Annual.R" includes R codes for reproducing Figs. 3–5 in the main manuscript and Figs. S5, S7, and S8 in the Supplementary Materials. However, we suggest the readers to use "Wrapper.R" instead of "Annual.R".

## Outputs
All the intermediate results related to Figures 3–5 in the main manuscript and Figures S5, S7, and S8 in the Supplementary Materials can be found in sub-repository "Annual/Outputs".
