### Figure 3 in Section 4.1 (and Figure S5 in Section S4.1.1)
Figure 3 illustrates some inference results of the annual data. Assume that we would use the intermediate results in item 2, then the total computational time without using the parallel computation is about 17.7 hours. The detailed computational time is provided in each item below. We also give all the intermediate results in the sub-repository "Annual/Outputs". Note that Figures 3-5 are all for annual data, so please do not clear the environment after reproducing Figure 3 if you want to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 as well.

1. Load 10 ensembles of annual data and necessary information (about 11.0 seconds)
2. Calculate $I_{fit}$ values under $R=2,\ldots,10$ and plot Figure 3(a) and S5(a) (Here we give the maximum computational time, about 3.0 hours, which is obtained by calculating $I_{fit}$ values under $R=10$ and using 10 cores in parallel. Then, the whole step will take no more than 27.3 hours. We provide the intermediate result "IfitwithRs.csv" so that readers could use it to plot Figure 3(a) directly if necessary.)
3. Evaluate the deterministic components $m_t(L_i,l_j)$ and $\sigma(L_i,l_j)$ at each grid point using $R=7$ ensembles and plot Figure 3(b) and S5(b) (about 0.6 seconds for each grid point $(L_i,l_j)$, $i=1,\ldots,I=192$ and $j=1,\ldots,J=288$. Without the parallel computation, this step takes 9.2 hours. We provide the intermediate results "Res_hatrho.csv", "Res_hatBeta.csv" and "Sig_Annual.csv".)
4. Calculate stochastic components $Z_t^{(r)}(L_i,l_j)$ by detrending $m_t(L_i,l_j)$ and rescaling $\sigma(L_i,l_j)$ (about 1.4 seconds)
5. Do SHT with $Q=144$ for the stochastic component $Z_t^{(r)}(L_i,l_j)$ at each ensemble $r$ and time point $t$ (about 4.2 seconds for each ensemble $r$ and each time point $t$, $r=1,\ldots,7$ and $t=1,\ldots,86$. Without the parallel computation, this step takes about 42.1 minutes.)
6. Calculate BIC values under different $Q$ values and plot Figure 3(c) (The major computation time is to calculate the inverse SHT with different values of $Q$. But this step takes time because it calculates the inverse SHT for each ensemble $r$, each time point $t$, and all candidates of $Q$. Take $Q=100$ as an example, which maximizes the computational time of inversing SHT in this step, it takes about 0.9 seconds for each $r$ and $t$. Without the parallel computation, this step takes at most $0.9\times 7\times 86\times (9+21+21)/3600=7.7$ hours. We provide the intermediate results "BIC_land.csv", "BIC_ocean.csv", "BICd_land.csv", and "BICd_ocean.csv".)
7. Calculate $v^2(L_i,l_j)$ under $Q_l=35$ and $Q_o=69$ and plot Figure 3(d) (The major computational time in this step is to calculate the inverse SHT with $Q=35$ and $69$ for each ensemble $r$, time point $t$. Without paralle, this step takes about $(0.27+0.42)\times 7\times 86/60=6.9$ minutes. We provide the intermediate outputs "v2hat.csv".)

### Figure 4 in Section 4.1
Figure 4 illustrates the temporal and spatial dependence structures of the annual data in spectral domain. Assume that we keep all intermediate results of reproducing Figure 3. The total computational time for ploting Figure 4 is about 7.3 minutes. All the intermediate outputs can be found in sub-repository "Annual/Outputs".

1. Do the real-valued transformation to SHT coefficients so that they are real-valued (about 1.4 seconds)
2. Model the temporal dependence structure using an autoregressive model with order $P=1$ and plot Figure 4(a) (about 0.4 seconds. We provide the intermediate results "Phihat.csv".)
3. Model the spatial dependence by evaluating the covariance matrix of (read-valued) SHT coefficients and plot Figures 4(b) and 4(c) (about 2.1 minutes. We provide the intermediate results "BIC_axial.csv".)
4. Assess spatial models by selecting auto-covariance at a selected latitide and plot Figures 4(d) (about 2.6 minutes)
5. As the same as the above item but use another latitude (about 2.6 minutes)

### Figure 5 in Section 4.1 (and Figures S7 and S8 in Section S4.1.3)
Figures 5, S7, and S8 illustrate the performance of the generated annual emulations. Assume that we keep all intermediate results of reproducing Figures 3 and 4. The total computational time for ploting Figures 5, S7, and S8 is about 6.2 minutes. All the intermediate outputs can be found in sub-repository "Annual/Outputs".

1. Caculate the covaraince matrix $\tilde{**U**}$ (about 0.4 seconds. We provide the intermediate result "U.mat".)
2. Do Cholescky decompostion on $\tilde{**U**}$ (about 0.6 seconds)
3. Generate $R'=7$ ensembles of annual emulations using 4 cores (about 3.5 minutes)
4. Calculate $I_{uq}$ values using 4 cores and plot Figures 5(a) and 5(b) (about 2.0 minutes. We provide the intermediate result "Iuq_axialnon.csv".)

6. Compare ensemble means and sds of annual emulations with those of simulations and plot Figures S7(a) and S7(c) (or Figures S7(b) and S7(d)) (about 2.4 seconds)
7. Compare time series of annual emulations with those of simulations and plot Figures S7(e) and S7(f) (0 second)
8. Compare periodograms of emulations with those of simulations and plot Figure S8(a) (or S8(b)) (about 1.4 seconds)

### Figures 6 and 7 in Section 4.2 (and Figures S14 and S15 in Section S4.3)
Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the performance of the generated daily emulations. These two figures take about 1.7 hours using the parallel computation with 4 cores. The inference process, which should be done before generating emulations, is illustrated in Figure S14. This figure takes about 773.4 hours without using the parallel computation. Figure S15 just shows daily time series. All these four plots are for daily data. The order should be Figure S14, 6, 7 and S15. Therefore, we give the entire procedure here together. All intermediate outputs are in sub-repository "Daily/Outputs".  

1. Load 7 ensembles of daily data and necessary information (about 1.9 minutes)
2. Model the deterministic components, evaluate $m_t(L_i,l_j)$ and $\sigma(L_i,l_j)$ for each grid point $(L_i,l_j)$, and plot Figures S14(a) and S14(b) (about 39.6 seconds for each $(L_i,l_j)$. Without the parallel computation, this steop takes about $39.6\times 192\times 288/3600=608.9$ hours. We provide intermediate results "BICforM.csv", "Res_Hatrho.csv", "BetaAB.mat", and "Daily_Sig.csv".)
3. Calculate stochastic components $Z_t^{(r)}(L_i,l_j)$ by detrending and rescaling (about 32.2 seconds)
4. Do SHT with $Q=144$ for the stochastic component at each ensemble $r$ and time point $t$ (about 4.2 seconds for each $r$ and each $t$. Without the parallel computation, it takes 4.2\times 7\times (5\times 365)/3600=14.9 hours.)
5. Calculate BIC values under different Q values and plot Figure S14(c) (The major computation time is for calculating the inverse SHT. But this step takes time because it calculates the inverse SHT for $r$, each $t$, and all candidates of $Q$. Take $Q=90$ as an example, which maximizes the computational time of inversing SHT, it takes about 0.9 seconds for each $r$ and $t$. If we run this step without doing the parallel computation, we would take at most $0.9\times 7\times (365\times5)\times(8+11+11)/3600=95.8$ hours. We provide intermeidate results "BIC_land.csv", "BIC_ocean.csv", "BICd_land.csv", and "BICd_ocean.csv".)
6. Calculate $v^2(L_i,l_j)$ under $Q_l=36$ and $Q_o=68$ and plot Figure S14(d) (The major computational time in this step is to calculate the inverse SHT with $Q=36$ and $68$ for each $r$ and $t$. It will take about $0.8\times 7\times 365\times 5/3600=2.8$ hours without the parallel computation. We provide the intermediate result "v2hat_do.csv".)
7. Do the real-valued transformation to SHT coefficients so that they are real values (about 4.2 seconds)
8. Test the normality of coefficients (about 11.5 seconds)
9. Choose the order of TGH autoregressive model for (non-Gaussian) time series at each coefficient $q$ using BIC and plot Figure S14(e) (about 46.3 hours without the parallel computation. We provide intermediate results "bicp_noTukey.csv" and "bicp_Tukey.csv".)
10. Model the temporal dependence structure using a Tukey g-and-h autoregressive model with order $P=1$ and plot Figure S14(f) (about 4.7 hours without the parallel computation. We provide the intermediate result "Tukeyres.csv".)
11. Model the spatial dependence by evaluating the covariance matrix of (read-valued and Gaussianized) SHT coefficients (about 1.3 minutes)
12. Calculate the covaraince matrix $\check{**U**}$  (about 0.3 seconds. We provide the intermediate result "U.mat".)
13. Generate $R'=7$ ensembles of daily emulations using 4 cores (about 1.0 hour)
14. Calculate $I_{uq}$ values using 4 cores and plot Figures 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) (about 39.2 minutes. We provide intermediate results "Iuq_noTukey.csv" and "Iuq_Tukey.csv".)
15. Calculate $WD_S$ values using 4 cores and plot Figures 6(c), 6(d), and 6(f) (about 2.2 minutes. We provide intermediate results "WD_time_noTukey.csv" and "WD_time_Tukey.csv")
