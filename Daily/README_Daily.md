# Daily
This sub-repository contains codes and key intermediate results related to the case study of daily surface temperature. It serves the purpose of reproducing Figures 6 and 7 in the main manuscript and Figures S14 and S15 in the Supplementary Materials. Moreover, it provides necessary examples to develop a daily SG and generate daily emulations.

## Code
1. "Daily_SG.R" includes R codes for developing a daily SG, given simulations and selected tuning parameters. It follows the Algorithm S1 in the Supplementary Materials.
2. "Daily_GenEmu.R" include R codes for generating daily emulations, given parameters in the daily SG. It follows the Algorithm 1 in the main manuscript.
3. "Daily.R" includes R codes for reproducing Figures 6 and 7 in the main manuscript and Figures S14 and S15 in Supplementary Materials. They can be taken as a supplement to the "Wrapper_Supplement.R".

## Outputs
All the intermediate results related to Figures 6 and 7 in the main manuscript and Figures S14 and S15 in the Supplementary Materials can be found in sub-repository "Daily/Outputs".
